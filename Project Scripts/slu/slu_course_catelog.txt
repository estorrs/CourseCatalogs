 ORES 5580 - Qualitative Research Methods (3)
Investigators conducting outcomes research seek to inform the development of clinical practice guidelines, to evaluate the quality of medical care, and to foster effective interventions to improve the quality of care. Outcomes research has traditionally used quantitative sciences and experimental designs to examine the utilization, cost, and clinical effectiveness of medical care. However, despite the utility of quantitative methods for measuring these important outcomes, these methods are not well suited to measure other complex aspects of the healthcare delivery system, such as organizational change, clinical leadership in implementing evidence-based guidelines, and patient perceptions of quality of care, which are also critical issues in outcomes research. These more nuanced aspects of healthcare delivery may be most appropriately examined with qualitative research methods. Qualitative research is a form of scientific inquiry that spans different disciplines and subject matter and utilizes many approaches including interview, observation, and focus group discussion, just to name a few. Qualitative studies are often exploratory in nature and seek to generate novel insights using inductive (starting with observations and developing hypotheses) rather than deductive (starting with extant hypotheses and testing them with observations) approaches. Such research is important in clinical outcomes research because it can illuminate aspects of organizational context and healthcare delivery that influence organizational performance and quality of care. Offered every summer.

<br>BIOLOGY OF EVIL<br/>Do the darkest parts of our nature have a biological component? Criminology, as a discipline, has been dominated by sociological theories of antisocial behavior that have argued against a biological component to adverse human outcomes. The end result of this dominance is that generations of criminology students are taught that social processes and environmental influences are paramount in explaining variation in criminal behavior. At the same time, evolutionary and genetic explanations of antisocial behavior have largely been censored from the discipline. Findings from biology, evolutionary psychology, behavioral genetics, molecular genetics, and neuroscience, however, have converged to show that every human behavior, prosocial, antisocial and criminal, is influenced (to varying degrees) by genetic factors. This course is design to make you fluent in what has been termed by the psychologist Steven Pinker as the new sciences of human nature.

UPD 5360 - Sustainability and the Built Environment (3)
In 1987 the World Commission on Environment and Development (aka the Bruntland Commission) was convened to address the growing concerns about environmental degradation in light of escalating human development. From that came the call to switch the world policy focus toward a more sustainable future. Sustainable development is most commonly defined as meeting the needs of our present generation while taking the needs of the future generation into consideration. The concept appears simply. Yet, the challenge lies in how we get there. What does it mean to meet the needs of our present generation? How do we define those needs? And what does it mean to take the needs of a future generation into consideration at the same time? What does all of that look like? There in lies the policy challenge. As we enter the second decade of the 21st century, the world looks vastly different from the time when these conversations about sustainable development began. Even within the past year, the policy frame has changed dramatically, suggesting that there is room for expanding the sustainable development discourse. In this course we explore those questions at the global, national, and local scale.
 UPD 5100 - Research Methods (3)
In this class, we will explore the basic methods used in planning and policy analysis. Whether as an urban planner or private developer/consultant, we all encounter policy reports and documents and are required to decipher them at some point in our careers. Many of us will also write these reports or use them as source material for grant proposals or funding requests, thus understanding the methods is essential to our work. This course provides the foundation for planning and policy analysis, examining the basic methods used in addressing planning and development problems. (Offered every fall.)
